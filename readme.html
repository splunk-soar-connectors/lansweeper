          </ul>
        </ul>
        <b>Note:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Please make sure to select the application type as <b>Personal Application</b>.
            The current integration will only support the Personal Application type.
          </li>
          <li>Keep your 'Application Identity Code' secure.</li>
          <li>
            API clients can use your 'Application Identity Code' to gain
            access to the APIs as your user. Keep this value somewhere safe
            and secure. Never share them with anyone.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Explanation of the Asset Configuration Parameters</h2>
      The asset configuration parameters affect 'test connectivity' and some
      other actions of the application. The parameters related to test
      connectivity action is Application Identity Code.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Application Identity Code: </b> Identity code for site data asset authorization.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Explanation of the Lansweeper Actions' Parameters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Test Connectivity (Action Workflow Details)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This action will test the connectivity of the Phantom server to the Lansweeper instance by making an
              initial API call using the provided asset configuration parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              The action will internally store the details of the authorized sites
              (provided by the user in the authorization flow) in the state file.
              These sites will be used for fetching the asset details in other actions.
            </li>
            <li>
              The action validates the provided asset configuration parameters. Based on the API call response, the
              appropriate success and failure message will be displayed when the action gets executed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>List Authorized Sites</h3>
          In order to retrieve information from a specific site, the application
          has to have permission to access the information from such site. The
          goal of this action is to retrieve the list of the authorized sites with
          their names and ID(s), which the application has access to. The user can
          use the Site ID from the output response as an input to the Hunt MAC or
          the Hunt IP actions. This action also stores/updates the authorized sites
          stored in the state file.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Action Parameter</b>: No action parameters are required.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Examples:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Get the Authorized Site ID(s) with their names.
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <li>No action parameters are required.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Hunt IP</h3>
          Fetch the details of the asset from the Lansweeper platform for the
          given Site ID and IP address. The Site ID can be retrieved from the
          output of the List Authorized Sites action. If the user leaves the Site ID field empty,
          the action will consider all the authorized sites as input which were stored in the state file
          during the test connectivity or list authorized sites action run. The paginator is
          implemented internally in this action which will paginate through the responses
          based on the assetPagination field. The max results per site parameter can be
          used to limit the output responses.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Action Parameter: Site ID</b>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This parameter is the unique key for a particular site. A site is
                like a workspace inside Lansweeper. Users can create and join
                several sites, within the same account. This is an optional parameter
                in order to get the asset details for a particular site. The action will
                consider the authorized sites as input if the user leaves the Site ID field
                empty. It expects a comma-separated string as an input parameter.
                If any one of the Site IDs is invalid in the comma-separated string, the action
                will skip that Site ID and continue with the valid ones. An error message
                will be shown if all the Site IDs are invalid. The Site ID can be retrieved
                from the output of the List Authorized Sites action.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Note:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The user can only provide the sites that were authorized during the Test Connectivity
                flow, as an input parameter to Site ID.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <b>Action Parameter: IP </b>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This parameter is basically an IP address of the assets.
                While passing this parameter we expect to get the details of the asset which are associated with this IP
                address.
                It expects a comma-separated string as an input parameter.
                If any one of the IPs is invalid in the comma-separated string, the action will skip that IP address and
                continue with the valid ones.
                An error message will be shown if all the IP addresses are invalid.
                This is a required parameter.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <b>Action Parameter: Max Results Per Site</b>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This parameter allows the user to limit the number of results per site.
                It expects a numeric value as an input. The default value is 50 for
                which it will fetch the first 50 assets from a particular site.
              </li>
