## Steps to Configure the Lansweeper Phantom app's asset

Follow these steps to configure the Lansweeper Phantom app's asset:

Log in to the Lansweeper platform.

  - Once logged in, all available sites for your account are shown.
  - Please select the sites for which you need to fetch the asset
    details.
  - Go to **Developers tools** by clicking the user's profile logo (Settings).
  - Click on **All applications**.
  - Select the application type as **Personal Application**.
  - Enter the application name and click **ADD APPLICATION**.
  - Now, Navigate to the created application from **All applications**.
  - Click on the **Authorize** button and select the sites which you want to authorize.
  - Copy the generated Application Identity Code.

Now, Log in to your Phantom instance.

  - Navigate to the **Home** dropdown and select **Apps**.
  - Search the Lansweeper App from the search box.
  - Click on the **CONFIGURE NEW ASSET** button.
  - Navigate to the **Asset Info** tab and enter the Asset name and Asset
    description.
  - Navigate to the **Asset Settings**.
  - Paste the generated **Application Identity Code** from Lansweeper UI to
    its respective configuration parameter.
  - Save the asset.
  - Now, test the connectivity of the Phantom server to the Lansweeper instance
    by clicking the **TEST CONNECTIVITY** button.

**Note**:

  - Please make sure to select the application type as **Personal Application**.
    The current integration will only support the Personal Application type.
  - Keep your 'Application Identity Code' secure.
  - API clients can use your 'Application Identity Code' to gain
    access to the APIs as your user. Keep this value somewhere safe
    and secure. Never share them with anyone.

## Explanation of the Asset Configuration Parameters

The asset configuration parameters affect 'test connectivity' and some
other actions of the application. The parameters related to test
connectivity action is Application Identity Code.

  - **Application Identity Code**: Identity code for site data asset authorization.
## Explanation of the Lansweeper Actions' Parameters

### Test Connectivity (Action Workflow Details)

  - This action will test the connectivity of the Phantom server to the
    Lansweeper instance by making an initial API call using the provided
    asset configuration parameters.
  - The action will internally store the details of the authorized sites
    (provided by the user in the authorization flow) in the state file.
    These sites will be used for fetching the asset details in other actions.
  - The action validates the provided asset configuration parameters.
    Based on the API call response, the appropriate success and failure
    message will be displayed when the action gets executed.

### List Authorized Sites

In order to retrieve information from a specific site, the application
has to have permission to access the information from such site. The
goal of this action is to retrieve the list of the authorized sites with
their names and ID(s), which the application has access to. The user can
use the Site ID from the output response as an input to the Hunt MAC or
the Hunt IP actions. This action also stores/updates the authorized sites
stored in the state file.

  - **Action Parameter**: No action
    parameters are required.
  - **Examples:**
      - Get the Authorized Site ID(s) with their names.
          - No action parameters are required.

### Hunt IP

Fetch the details of the asset from the Lansweeper platform for the
given Site ID and IP address. The Site ID can be retrieved from the
output of the List Authorized Sites action. If the user leaves the Site ID field empty,
the action will consider all the authorized sites as input which were stored in the state file
during the test connectivity or list authorized sites action run. The paginator is implemented
internally in this action which will paginate through the responses based on the assetPagination field.
The max results per site parameter can be used to limit the output responses.

**Action Parameter: Site ID**

  - This parameter is the unique key for a particular site. A site is
    like a workspace inside Lansweeper. Users can create and join
    several sites, within the same account. This is an optional parameter
    in order to get the asset details for a particular site. The action will
    consider the authorized sites as input if the user leaves the Site ID field
    empty. It expects a comma-separated string as an input parameter.
    If any one of the Site IDs is invalid in the comma-separated string, the action
    will skip that Site ID and continue with the valid ones. An error message
    will be shown if all the Site IDs are invalid. The Site ID can be retrieved
    from the output of the List Authorized Sites action.

**Note:**

  - The user can only provide the sites that were authorized during the Test Connectivity
    flow, as an input parameter to Site ID.

**Action Parameter: IP**

  - This parameter is basically an IP address of the assets. While
    passing this parameter we expect to get the details of the asset
    which are associated with this IP address. It expects a
    comma-separated string as an input parameter. If any one of the IPs
    is invalid in the comma-separated string, the action will skip that IP
    address and continue with the valid ones. An error message will be
    shown if all the IP addresses are invalid. This is a required
    parameter.

**Action Parameter: Max Results Per Site**

  - This parameter allows the user to limit the number of results per site.
    It expects a numeric value as an input. The default value is 50 for
    which it will fetch the first 50 assets from a particular site.

**Examples:**

  - List the asset details with the IP address '10.0.1.3' and consider all the
    authorized sites as input for the Site ID parameter.
      - Site ID = ""
      - IP = "10.0.1.3"

  - List the asset details with the IP address '10.0.1.3' and Site ID
    '00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5c76'.
      - Site ID = "00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5c76"
      - IP = "10.0.1.3"


  - List the asset details with the IP address '10.0.1.3' and Site ID
    '00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5c76'. The results should also be
    limited to 15.
      - Site ID = "00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5c76"
      - IP = "10.0.1.3"
      - Max Results Per Site = 15


  - List the asset details with the IP address '10.0.1.3'
    and Site ID '00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5c76' or '00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5d23'. The results
    should also be limited to 50 for a particular site.
      - Site ID = "00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5c76, 00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5d23"
      - IP = "10.0.1.3"
      - Max Results Per Site = 50

**Note:**

  - Max Results Per Site value will be handled internally, which will paginate through
    the assets for a particular site.

### Hunt MAC

Fetch the details of the asset from the Lansweeper platform for the
given Site ID and MAC address. The Site ID can be retrieved from the
output of the List Authorized Sites action. If the user leaves the Site ID field empty,
the action will consider all the authorized sites as input which were stored in the state file
during the test connectivity or list authorized sites action run. The paginator is
implemented internally in this action which will paginate through the responses
based on the assetPagination field. The max results per site parameter can be
used to limit the output responses.

**Action Parameter: Site ID**

  - This parameter is the unique key for a particular site. A site is
    like a workspace inside Lansweeper. Users can create and join
    several sites, within the same account. This is an optional parameter
    in order to get the asset details for a particular site. The action will
    consider the authorized sites as input if the user leaves the Site ID field
    empty. It expects a comma-separated string as an input parameter.
    If any one of the Site IDs is invalid in the comma-separated string, the action
    will skip that Site ID and continue with the valid ones. An error message
    will be shown if all the Site IDs are invalid. The Site ID can be retrieved
    from the output of the List Authorized Sites action.

**Note:**

  - The user can only provide the sites that were authorized during the Test Connectivity
    flow, as an input parameter to Site ID.

**Action Parameter: MAC**

  - This parameter is basically a MAC address of the assets. While
    passing this parameter we expect to get the details of the asset
    which are associated with this MAC address. It expects a
    comma-separated string as an input parameter. If any one of the MAC
    addresses is invalid in the comma-separated string, the action will skip
    that MAC address and continue with the valid ones. An error message
    will be shown if all the MAC addresses are invalid. This is a
    required parameter.

**Action Parameter: Max Results Per Site**

  - This parameter allows the user to limit the number of results. It
    expects a numeric value as an input. The default value is 50 for
    which it will fetch the first 50 assets from a particular site.

**Examples:**

  - List the asset details with the MAC address '68:FB:7E:71:00:00' and
    consider all the authorized sites as input for the Site ID parameter.
      - Site ID = ""
      - MAC = "68:FB:7E:71:00:00"


  - List the asset details with the MAC address '68:FB:7E:71:00:00' and
    Site ID '00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5c76'.
      - Site ID = "00d4ed4f-b2ad-4587-91b5-07bd453c5c76"
